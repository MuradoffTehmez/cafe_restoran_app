- **Bug reports**: Identifying issues and helping us improve the stability of the system.
- **Feature suggestions**: Proposing new features or enhancements.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Git**: Version control system for managing code changes.
- **Visual Studio / IDE of your choice**: Development environment for coding.
- **.NET Framework**: Required for the project's backend.
- **SQL Server**: Database for storing and managing order data.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   - For backend: Install necessary NuGet packages.
   - For frontend: Install front-end dependencies using npm or yarn.

4. Set up the database:

### Running Tests
Before submitting any changes, please make sure all tests are passing. To run the tests:
- Use the built-in test runner in Visual Studio or your preferred testing framework.
- Ensure that all unit tests and integration tests pass before submitting your changes.

## Workflow

### Branching and Merging
- **Master branch**: The main production-ready code.
- **Develop branch**: The default development branch where new features and bug fixes are integrated.
- **Feature branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you work on. Name the branches based on the feature or issue, e.g., `feature/login-system` or `bugfix/order-validation`.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new feature branch from `develop`.
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
4. Push the changes to your fork and create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to `develop`.
5. Ensure your PR is well-documented and includes relevant issue references.
6. Your PR will be reviewed by the maintainers, and feedback will be provided.

### Coding Style Guidelines
- Follow standard C# and SQL coding conventions.
- Ensure your code is well-documented, with clear comments and descriptions.
- Write clear and meaningful commit messages.
- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs, as per project preference).

## Reporting Issues

2. Click on **New Issue** and provide a clear title and description of the problem.
3. If applicable, include steps to reproduce the issue and expected vs. actual behavior.
4. Please indicate the environment you are using (e.g., OS version, database version, etc.).

## Feature Requests

If you have a new feature or improvement in mind:
1. Create a new issue with the label **Feature Request**.
2. Provide a detailed description of the feature, why it’s needed, and any suggestions on implementation.
3. Discuss the feature with the community before submitting a PR.
